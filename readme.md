    1. (Suggested by the course) For a closer look at the arithmetic behind convolution, and how it is affected by your choice of padding scheme, stride and other parameters, please refer to this illustrated guide: [V. Dumoulin and F. Visin, A guide to convolution arithmetic for deep learning](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.07285v1.pdf).
